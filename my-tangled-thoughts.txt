cur.execute('SELECT password FROM admins WHERE username=\'%s\'' % request.form['username'].replace('%', '%%')) == 0:

admins:
    id | username | password
    1  | xyz      | deneen

    (Only one record... or that's what I think)

Time based injection w SLEEP()
Can't see the output

Ideally, I'd want to have
    i. All Table Names
        a. All Column names from a table


So, I have a PAYLOAD, and a parameter that we will iterate over the all possible characters.


===== PRECURSOR =====

information_schema is a database that contains metadata about all the other tables, thier columns, user privilages & permissions, 'SYSTEM' stuffs you could think of...


Tables to be aware of

1. information_schema.schemata

    Schemata table contains the information about the databases you have in your SQL server.

    Information such as: their names(aka SCHEMA_NAME), character set, encryption settings, and so on.

    Schemata table is useful and should be your first step to find out the name of databases.


2. information_schema.tables

    Now you might want to sit down here, Table `tables` contains information about ALL the tables from ALL the databases.

    So, if you want to list out the table names of database say 'testing', then you could do something like this.

    `select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'testing'`
